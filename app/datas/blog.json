        "body": "<h2>Introducing Jacob Yi</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Hey there! Welcome to my personal blog. I'm&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Jacob Yi</span><span style=\"font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">, a passionate individual who finds joy in the simple pleasures of life. From hitting the gym and diving into captivating books to exploring my culinary skills and embarking on thrilling journeys, I strive to make the most of every moment. Today, I want to share with you three main identities, the 3 Fs, that define who I am: my unyielding Faith as a Christian, the profound significance of Family in my life, and the pursuit of Freedom in various forms.\"</span></p>\n<h3>Faith</h3>\n<p>Above everything else, my Christian faith is at the core of my being. I am immensely grateful for my parents and the way they raised me in a Christian household, instilling in me a strong moral compass and a deep love for God. Throughout my life, I've been blessed to cross paths with numerous godly individuals who have influenced and shaped my spiritual journey. Their wisdom, guidance, and unwavering support have been invaluable in helping me grow as a person. I hold tightly to my faith, for it gives me strength, purpose, and a sense of belonging.</p>\n<h3>Family</h3>\n<p>Beyond my faith, my family holds an unrivaled place in my heart. They are my foundation, my source of love, and my constant motivation. As I envision my future, I aspire to create a nurturing and loving environment for not only my immediate family but also for the family I hope to build one day. I am committed to dedicating myself to their well-being, even if it means sacrificing my own personal desires. Family, for me, is a lifelong commitment to love, cherish, and uplift one another.</p>\n<h3>Freedom</h3>\n<p>When it comes to freedom, financial independence plays a pivotal role. The ability to provide for myself and others without relying on anyone or anything is a goal I strive to achieve. Financial freedom allows me to indulge not only in my own desires but also to bless those around me. I view money as a tool that, when managed wisely, can enhance the quality of life for myself and my loved ones. Moreover, my fascination with Bitcoin stems from its promise of freedom money, providing decentralized transactions without the need for intermediaries. Although I contemplated making finance a separate identity, I consider it part of the broader spectrum of freedom.</p>\n<p>Thank you for joining me on this introductory blog post as I unveil the three main identities, the 3 Fs, that shape who I am: faith, family, and freedom. As Proverbs 10:4 in the NIV, reminds us, <em>'Lazy hands make for poverty, but diligent hands bring wealth.'</em> It is with this wisdom that I embrace my faith as a Christian, cherishing the profound significance of family in my life, and pursuing freedom in various forms. In the upcoming posts, I look forward to delving deeper into each of these aspects, sharing my experiences, insights, and reflections. Stay tuned for more exciting content as we embark on a journey of inspiration and discovery together.</p>\n<p>Feel free to reach out for a chat through&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:jakeyi00@gmail.com\" rel=\"follow\">email</a></p>",

        "body" : "<p>I'll be exploring the various frameworks that shape my identity and guide my journey through life. At the core of who I am is my faith in Christianity and my relationship with Christ. This forms the foundation of my values, principles, and daily living. Additionally, I embrace contrarianism and Stoicism as complementary perspectives that enrich my understanding of the world and inform my actions. Join me as I delve into these three facets of my identity and reflect on how they shape my outlook on life.</p>\n<p><strong>Christianity:</strong> My identity as a Christian is paramount, defining every aspect of my existence. Through my belief in Christ, I find purpose, meaning, and direction. I strive to emulate His teachings and example, seeking to love unconditionally, forgive graciously, and serve selflessly. Each day, I endeavor to live in accordance with His will, guided by the values of faith, hope, and love.</p>\n<p><strong>Contrarianism:</strong> As a contrarian, I embrace the challenge of questioning prevailing norms and ideologies. Inspired by Romans 12:2, which urges believers not to conform to the patterns of this world, I recognize the importance of independent thought and critical analysis. I pride myself in being a contrarian, valuing dissent and skepticism as catalysts for growth and progress.</p>\n<p><strong>Stoicism:</strong> In embracing Stoicism, I acknowledge the transient nature of life's joys and sorrows. Drawing wisdom from Stoic philosophy, I find solace in the understanding that pain is temporary and even necessary for growth. Central to my identity as a Stoic is the cultivation of self-control, resilience, and acceptance of the things beyond my control. Through practicing mindfulness and maintaining equanimity, I strive to navigate life's challenges with grace and fortitude.</p>\n<p>In weaving together the threads of Christianity, contrarianism, and Stoicism, I find a tapestry of identity that reflects my values, beliefs, and aspirations. Grounded in faith, empowered by dissent, and fortified by resilience, I embrace the complexities of life with courage and conviction. Join me on this journey of self-discovery and exploration as I continue to navigate the intersections of faith, reason, and philosophy in shaping my identity.</p>",

These pursuits ignite my spirit, guiding me through a kaleidoscope of experiences that shape my identity and enrich my existence.</p>\n<p>Travel is not just a passion but an enriching journey that leaves indelible marks on my soul, fostering a profound appreciation for the world's wonders. I love to immerse myself in diverse cultures, traversing the globe from large metropolitan cities to distant remote nature places, and forging connections with people from all walks of life.</p>\n<p>I also like to immerse myself in the world of literature, where reading and writing serve as my sanctuaries, allowing me to explore new ideas, perspectives, and worlds through captivating novels or personal reflections. Though I wish I had started reading and writing more earlier, I am grateful for the journey I've embarked upon, finding solace and inspiration in the pages of countless stories.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, I also find solace in the simplicity of lacing up my running shoes and hitting the pavement. Running isn't just about physical fitness for me; it's a form of meditation, a way to clear my mind and reconnect with myself. Whether it's a leisurely jog through the park or a challenging sprint, the feeling of freedom that comes with each step is truly exhilarating.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, these passions of travel, reading, and running are not merely hobbies but integral parts of my identity. They shape my experiences, broaden my horizons, and provide me with a profound sense of fulfillment. Whether I'm traversing distant lands, losing myself in the pages of a book, or pounding the pavement on a morning run, these pursuits fuel my curiosity, invigorate my spirit, and remind me of the boundless beauty and wonder that exist in the world around us.</p>",

        "body": "<p>As April rolls around, I find myself delivering this month's blog post a bit earlier due to my upcoming travels and birthday celebrations. Turning 24 brings to mind the number 24 worn by Kobe Bryant, symbolizing the Mamba mentality and his relentless work ethic&mdash;a beacon as I navigate through this year and beyond. As I type this on April 19th, I'm aboard a flight returning to California, reflecting on the past year since my move to Kansas City. This moment isn't just poetic because it aligns with my personal journey, but because it resonates deeply as I commemorate the exact date of my move a year ago, embarking on a new chapter of my life.</p>\n<p>This moment a year ago mirrors an iconic scene from Star Wars, where Luke Skywalker stares into the sunset, the stirring melodies of John Williams&rsquo; composition setting the mood for his uncertain future. Just like Luke, exactly one year ago, I boarded a one-way flight to Kansas City, stepping into a mission filled with unknowns. The parallels of leaving home to embrace a destiny not yet written resonated deeply as I left California behind, my own version of the Tatooines' suns dipping below the horizon. As California stretched out before me, I couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia for the beauty of California and its sunsets, unsure of when I would be back to see them in person.</p>\n<p>Speaking of the beauty of California, you can learn a lot from the magnificent trees that stand hundreds of feet tall and have lived for centuries. Their steadfastness in the face of adversity serves as a testament to the power of resilience and the enduring spirit of nature. The journey this past year has been anything but easy. There were moments when it felt as if I had lost everything, akin to trees that shed their leaves in the harshest of winters. Yet, just as the trees endure and stand resilient, awaiting the spring, I too have grown stronger amidst the adversities. The saying goes, \"The stronger the wind, the stronger the tree,\" and indeed, the challenges I've faced have fortified my resolve and spirit. This newfound resilience is something I carry with me as I continue on this path of self-discovery and personal growth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Just as the ancient trees stand tall, weathered by the seasons yet resolute, so too do the beautiful cathedrals and castles in Europe, each brick and stone a testament to the enduring legacy of human perseverance. I draw inspiration from these timeless structures and think about the thousands of stone masons and laborers who painstakingly built these magnificent cathedrals and castles across Europe that still stand today. These buildings, which took generations to complete, stand as testaments to human resilience and dedication. Most workers never saw the completion of their work, yet they laid each stone with the hope of creating something grand. Like them, I hope to build something grand but have learned to appreciate the journey of building my own life, understanding that the fruits of today's labor may not be seen for years to come. Sidenote, I have yet to visit them in person so if you are reading this and feeling generous just let me know.</p>\n<p>As I turn the page on another year, I want to take a moment to express my gratitude&mdash;to the One who opens doors and provides beyond measure. Thank you, God, for your unwavering presence and your boundless blessings. I hope I never cease to be grateful for all that you have done and continue to do for me. I also owe a huge debt of gratitude to my family and friends who have not only been my rock through thick and thin but also a constant source of inspiration and motivation. Their unwavering support has been my guiding light, helping me weather the highs and lows of this journey. I wouldn't be who I am today without them by my side.&nbsp;So, as I conclude this reflection on turning 24, I'm reminded of the exciting road that lies ahead. Life's beauty lies in its endless potential for growth and the pursuit of going the distance when the distance is unknown. Every step we take shapes us, leading us not just to a goal but towards our true selves. Like the saying goes, the seeds we plant today won't bear fruit immediately, but that's all part of the adventure. So here's to planting seeds, nurturing growth, and eagerly embracing the beautiful unknown that awaits us. Cheers to the next chapter!</p>",
